# Analysis Phase Preparation

## Required Actions
1. Map all components in NeoSnipe/
2. Document dependencies
3. Identify overlap areas
4. Review test coverage
5. Document technical debt
6. List optimization opportunities

## Tools Needed
- Code analysis tools
- Dependency mapper
- Test coverage reporter

## Output Expected
- Component map
- Dependency graph
- Overlap report
- Technical debt document
- Optimization opportunities list
