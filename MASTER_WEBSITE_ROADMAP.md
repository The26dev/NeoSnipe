# Master Website Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap serves as the single source of truth for completing the NeoSnipe website development. It consolidates all existing documentation and provides a clear, step-by-step guide for development completion.

## Phase 0: Codebase Consolidation (Current)
**Reference Documents:**
- Consolidated_Implementation_Plan.md
- CONSOLIDATION_CHECKLIST.md
- Consolidation_Plan.md

### Steps:
1. Complete backup processes (as outlined in Consolidated_Implementation_Plan.md)
2. Execute analysis phase (Days 3-4)
3. Perform integration process (Days 5-7)
4. Complete testing & validation
5. Update documentation
6. Execute final cleanup steps

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
**Reference Documents:**
- NeoSnipe_Development_Plan.md
- CONTINUOUS_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md

### Steps:
1. WebGL Resource Management Setup
2. Sacred Geometry Integration (following CONTINUOUS_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md principles)
3. Core API Implementation
4. Performance Optimization Framework
5. Security Infrastructure Setup

## Phase 2: Frontend Development
**Reference Documents:**
- NeoSnipe/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
- src/market_analysis/INTEGRATION_PLAN.md

### Steps:
1. User Interface Components Implementation
   - Implement core components
   - Apply sacred geometry principles to layouts
   - Build responsive design system
2. Market Analysis Integration
   - Follow src/market_analysis/INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
   - Implement real-time data visualization
3. WebGL Features Integration
   - 3D visualization components
   - Performance optimization
4. User Experience Enhancement
   - Animations and transitions
   - Interactive elements
   - Accessibility features

## Phase 3: Integration and Testing
**Reference Documents:**
- Consolidated_Implementation_Plan.md (Testing section)
- NeoSnipe_Development_Plan.md (Phase 3)

### Steps:
1. Component Integration
2. End-to-End Testing
3. Performance Testing
4. Security Testing
5. Cross-browser Testing
6. Mobile Responsiveness Testing

## Phase 4: Documentation and Deployment
**Reference Documents:**
- NeoSnipe_Development_Plan.md (Phase 4)

### Steps:
1. API Documentation Updates
2. User Documentation
3. Developer Documentation
4. Deployment Pipeline Setup
5. Production Environment Configuration
6. Launch Preparation

## Quality Gates
Each phase must pass these quality checks before proceeding:
1. Code Quality Review
2. Performance Benchmarks
3. Security Assessment
4. Accessibility Compliance
5. Sacred Geometry Alignment
6. Documentation Completeness

## Timeline
- Phase 0: 1-2 weeks (Current)
- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 3: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 4: 1-2 weeks

## Files to Be Removed
The following files can be removed as their content has been consolidated into this master roadmap:
- CONTINUOUS_DEVELOPMENT_NEXT_STEPS.md
- CONTINUOUS_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md
- CONTINUOUS_AI_WORKFLOW.md
- PROMPT_WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION.md
- setup_phase_prompts.md
- PROMPT_TEMPLATES.md
- PROMPT_ROADMAP.md
- todo.md

## Success Criteria
1. All phases completed according to timeline
2. All quality gates passed
3. Sacred geometry principles properly implemented
4. Fully documented codebase
5. Optimized performance metrics
6. Comprehensive test coverage
7. Security compliance achieved
