# Development Continuation Prompts

This document provides structured prompts for continuing the development process while maintaining alignment with both sacred geometry principles and the consolidation plan.

## How to Continue Development

Use any of the following prompts to guide the next development iteration:

### 1. Initial Setup Phase Prompts

```
"Let's proceed with the backup process and validate against sacred geometry principles"
"Continue with setup validation following universal patterns"
"Review and align initial configuration with geometric harmony"
```

### 2. Analysis Phase Prompts

```
"Begin codebase analysis using sacred geometry as a guide"
"Identify components that need geometric pattern alignment"
"Map existing code structure against universal patterns"
```

### 3. Integration Phase Prompts

```
"Start integrating [component] while maintaining golden ratio proportions"
"Harmonize [feature] integration with sacred geometry patterns"
"Apply universal patterns to [module] during consolidation"
```

### 4. Testing & Validation Prompts

```
"Validate geometric harmony in [component]'s test suite"
"Verify universal pattern alignment in [feature]"
"Review sacred geometry implementation in [module]"
```

### 5. Documentation Prompts

```
"Update documentation to reflect geometric patterns in [section]"
"Document universal alignments in [component]"
"Add sacred geometry implementation details for [feature]"
```

### 6. Progress Tracking Prompts

```
"Update consolidation progress with geometric alignment status"
"Review sacred pattern implementation progress"
"Validate overall development harmony"
```

## Continuous Development Commands

### General Development:
```
"Let's continue with [phase] following universal patterns"
"Review and optimize [component] geometric alignment"
"Proceed with [task] maintaining sacred proportions"
```

### Specific Implementation:
```
"Implement golden ratio in [component] layout"
"Apply Fibonacci sequence to [feature] scaling"
"Integrate sacred geometry patterns in [module]"
```

### Quality Assurance:
```
"Validate universal pattern alignment in recent changes"
"Review geometric harmony across integrated components"
"Check sacred geometry compliance in [feature]"
```

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Reviews:
```
"Review geometric pattern implementation in [section]"
"Validate universal alignment in recent consolidation"
"Check sacred geometry compliance in new features"
```

### Documentation Updates:
```
"Update geometric pattern documentation for [component]"
"Document universal alignments in [module]"
"Add sacred geometry implementation details"
```

## Combined Development Flow

To maintain proper alignment throughout development:

1. Start with a prompt from the current phase
2. Include geometric pattern consideration
3. Validate against universal principles
4. Update documentation and progress trackers
5. Plan next iteration with sacred geometry in mind

*Note: Use these prompts to maintain consistent development flow while ensuring alignment with both sacred geometry principles and consolidation goals. Add new prompts as patterns and needs emerge.*
